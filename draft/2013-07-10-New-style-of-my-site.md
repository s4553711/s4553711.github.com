Main Story
---
I have just reviewed some website and adjusted the my layout of article list page according to these websites. But it is not done yet because I found that it is a little bit difficult to design a good template with my own idea, so maybe jsut start from imitating other websites. Below I list some of my template as designing my website:

1. [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/articles/): clean and simple.
2. [stash](http://zespia.tw/Octopress-Theme-Slash/): looks graceful.
3. [blog.iwinux.info](http://blog.iwinux.info/)
4. [Collection of octopress themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes)
